## Abstract

The real world offers circumstances in which individuals must simultaneously explore their options or choices
while also maximizing some variables such as their output, well-being or wealth.
In economic activities, this is translated into a profit perspective. Logged bandit dataset are useful in this regard,
with several procedures available in the literature to deal with the revenue maximization problem.
Considering the click-rate of a large-scale fashion e-commerce platform, we will compare some common algo-
rithms. This informal comparison may suggest the policies that yield the most profit.
